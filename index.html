<h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>

<p class = "p1">HiHi~ I’m Lukas and this web page is for my PDP</p>
<p>I will tell everyone what I learnt from this Semester. I hope you’ll find it interesting of what I done during my first year in collage’s programming class.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I am a guy that is inspired my music basically in my free time I play piano or study how to use MIDI</p>

<h2>Career in the future</h2>
<p>The position I am aiming for is an IT Business Clerk, it sounds impossible for the current me but as this is my goal, I will keep on improving my programming skills and catch up what I missed. I will use the up break to strengthen my understanding in python programming, my plan is to go to the local bookstore to buy books to understand the basics of python and further understand it through the amazing platform called Github because there are a lot of very nice people that are willing help out newbies like me when they encounter coding problems.</p>


<h2>My Reflection</h2>
<p>The truth is it is extremely hard for me</p>
<p>I often could not catch up what is being taught in class or I do not understand the function of the program maybe even do not know what is happening. However, I that did not stop me from learning and trying to be “friends” with python, trust me it is not fun at all it might even more painful than been bitten by a snake. All things aside, I was lucky that Mr.Chan and my groupmates provide me a huge amount of supports like teaching me how to understand what the coding is about or what the program is trying to perform. </p>
